Method Overriding:
    It happens when same method with different implementation exists ina Parent and Child class.
Why should we override a method?
    1. Flexibility: when we inherit from a class, if we don't like some methods then we can modify them.
Rules:
    1. Private methods and constructors cannot be overridden because they don't participate in Inheritance.
       Constructors belong to fields and methods of a class which created, so cannot be inherited in another class.
    2. If we want to override from another class, we must Recreate that exact method inside the Child class and can
        have or change it to different implementation. Only access modifiers can be different except private access,
        but can have more visibility based on access modifiers than the method inside the parent class.
        We can ONLY increase the visibility of modifier, CANNOT decrease it.
Important:
    Always the inherited method we want in Child class should be the same as declared in Parent class.
    For example: The same access modifier, or if its static method, it should be used the same.

**** Constructors initializes the instance fields of the class and always good to create constructor of the same instance fields
    We can create an instance method Also, we can
    create constructor with the name of Class (with or without parameters).
1. Shortcut: right click in editor -> Generate constructor -> select the fields -> click Enter.
2. If we don't create a class constructor, java compiler creates it by default (No parameter) in behind scene
    (can be seen in Out folder or bin in everytime we create main method and run the class) but once we create constructor, its gone.
3. If press Ctrl+O or Right Click and press (To override method) -> select the method and click enter.

Note: @Deprecated annotation: it means the Devs don't recommend using this,
it might be dangerous or not a good option ... if used the compiler generates a warning
    So, there are better alternatives exist

Upcasting : storing something from a smaller datatype into a bigger datatype. Example: into variable => double variable
For WebDriver class, instead of Child class Chrome we can change it.
Example:   Chrome googleChrome = new Chrome();  .... now we can upcast it to bigger space object

WebDriver webDriver = new Chrome();
webDriver.startBrowser();

*********** Polymorphism *******************

When we achieve Polymorphism by overriding a method and by doing inheritance .... its called Dynamic Polymorphism

Another way of achieving Polymorphism is method overloading... called static polymorphism

Polymorphism two ways:
Compile time: with the help of overloading
Run time: with the help of overriding method

---------------- Final Keyword --------------------------

Final keyword: When it's used with a variable, the value will not be changed (immutable) because its marked as Final.
               When it's used with a method, that method cannot be overridden
               When it's used with a class, it cannot be inherited by another class
Rules of Final:
    99 % of time, Final keyword is used with static keyword.
