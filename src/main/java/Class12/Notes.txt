OOPs => Object Oriented Programming:
    Its just a way of writing code that follows certain rules or guidelines. We create classes that have
    first (attributes/properties OR fields) second (Method, function OR behavior).

Why we should learn OOPs?
    1. IT simplifies the software development and maintenance which is adding new features changing to the existing code.
    2. Code duplication is reduced.
    3. It also helps us represent something from our real life with the help of class and object.

What is Class?
    It is a blueprint /design from which the actual real life objects are created. So, computer uses a class
    to check what that class can do, Example:
    Scannner scan=new Scanner(System.in); Here Scanner is a Java built-in class, scan is an object of Scanner class.
    with the help of object, we can use the methods/behaviors from a class so that we can use properties/fields from that class.
What is Object?
    Objects are created from classes, also called Instances.... we can use them to call method/properties from those classes.

Note:
Inside a class, the sequence doesn't matter, you can define the methods first or the properties first.
But, when we are inside the method, then the sequence matters.
   // because we call the fields based on sequence through the object in System.out.println();
           // We can create as many objects as we want... hundreds/thousands

String Methods:  .length()

This method returns the length of this String. The length is equal to the number of 15-bit unicode characters in String.
Syntax:
String.length()

ASCI Table in Java:

Every character/ letter/ number has a Number representation in Java.
Stands for: American Standard Code for Information used to represent alpha-numberic data.
