Methods in Java:
    Method is a collection of java statements and blocks of code.
Why we should learn methods:
    1. It allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them,
        build those methods one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application.
    2. Methods allow us to reuse the code once created. it has re-usability .
    3. Methods allow us to be flexible, change or update the method.

How can we create Methods ?
    There are two types of methods: 1. Built-in  2. User Defined.

Built-in Methods:
    The which are designed by the Java developers. For example, the println() , nextInt(), method in the Scanner class,
    length(),  present in String class they are all built-in methods.
User Defined Methods:
    The methods that we write.

Methods which return something when called and others are methods which do not return anything when called.

    int add(int a, int b){
    return a+b;
    }
int => return type of a method
add => name of the method
(int a, int b) => parameters OR input of the method
{ } => body of the method

Rules:
    Return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match.
    We can only assign methods to the variables of the same type.
=================================================================================================
Variables:
    There are 3 types of variables with respect to their scope. Local Variable, Instance Variable, Static Variable.
1. Local Variable:
        If a variable is created inside a block of code { } , like inside method Or main method, loop, if-else condition, etc...
        They are called Local Variable.
  Local Variable Upside OR Advantage:
        Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. You should always try to write code with
        the help of local variables. They are created as long as we need them, once we are done, the memory becomes empty again.
        But Instance and Static Variable stays and occupy computer memory even we don't use them.
  Local Variable Downside:
        They cannot be accessed outside the block in which they are created, always accessible inside block of code { }.
         They have very limited scope. smaller scope, only inside th block of code { }
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Instance Variable:
        All the variables which are created inside a class, but outside of the methods or main method are called
        Instance Variable.
  Instance Variable Upside:
        We can use them or access it in all the instance methods of that Class. Their scope is larger than Local variables.
  Downside:
        They stay longer in the memory as compared to local variable. so it reserve space in RAM.

    3. Static Variable:
       It's a variable that has always have Static keyword and exists outside of methods.
    Upside:
    ONly occupy one memory location from the RAM, even though we create 1000 objects of that class.
    Also, Static variable can be accessed/used in any code inside the Class, in any method of a Class,
     Can be accessed with any object of that Class to get the value. Static has the most wide scope.
     Important:
        When we have Static method, or variable... we can directly call it in the same class in System.out.println()
        with out creating any object or instance of that class.

  DownSide of Static:
    They are loaded into the memory RAM when a class is loaded even though you don't use them.
