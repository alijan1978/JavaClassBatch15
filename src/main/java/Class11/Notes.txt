 2D Arrays:
    Two Dimension Arrays are arrays that contain 1 D arrays in it.
 Why should we learn 2D Array?
    Because 2D Arrays allow us to store multiple one D arrays which gives us more flexibility to store data.
    Ex: if we have to store data from Excel files, we can use 2D arrays.

 Syntax to create 2D arrays:
    Datatype[][] nameofArray = new Datatype[sizeOf Rows][];
 2nd way:
    Datatype [][] nameOfArray = {{ data, data, data }, { data, data, data}, {data, data, data, data, data}};

 OOPs Concept:
    Its just some set of rules that if we follow, we achieve many advantages.
    Object Oriented Programing .. helps us how to make/bring changes to the existing code without breaking the code.
    How to isolate responsibilities? how write code in smaller blocks and to use those blocks to build complex bigger things.
    1. how to avoid repetition... code repetition is minimized
    2. how to make easy... changing existing code and adding new features becomes easier.
    3. how to maintain the code and or add any features with rules of OOPS ..
    4. translate the problems and represent the entities from our real lives inside the computers
       - Representing the real life entities becomes easier.
    5. OOPS helps us to write a secure code...
