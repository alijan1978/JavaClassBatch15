Logical Operators:
    Just another set of symbols that we can use to combine multiple boolean values.
    There are three logical operators:
   1. ! => Not
   2. && => And
   3.|| => OR

    By using logical operators, we can simplify the logic if we use these operators
   NOT Operator ! :

            False   =>  True
            True    =>  False
        used to negate the boolean values if something is true, it will make it false
        if something is false, it will make it true.

   And operator &&:

        False   False   => False
        False   True    => False
        True    False   => False
        True    True    => True

   OR operator || :

        False   False   => False
        False   True    => True
        True    False   => True
        True    True    => True

   What is Switch Case statement?
   Switch Case Statement is just another ways of achieving the same results as if-else statement conditions

   Why we should learn it?
   The reason we should use them is that they are very faster than is statement
   Syntax:
            String variable:
                    switch(variable){
                    case 1:
                    system.out.println("print number 1 ");
                    }
------------------------------------------------------------

        // Important: We can only use Switch Case with (byte, short, int, char, String )  Not boolean
//        boolean rich = true;
//        switch (rich)

//        Also : we cannot use Relational Operators with Switch Statement, as below:
//        int number=10;
//        switch (number)
//            case number>5 || number<10
