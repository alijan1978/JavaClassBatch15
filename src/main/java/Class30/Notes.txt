If we have to read the data from a file manually from our computer, what do we need to do?
    1. We need to know where the file is stored on our computer.
    2. We need to navigate to that folder
    3. A software that understands/operate how that data is stored in those files.

SAME THING: If we do this in programming via coding, we need to have the path of our file, then we need jar to read our file.
To create a new Directory on our project which is properties file:
1. Right-Click on your project name
2. New -> Directory (you can open a Package as well) -> Enter the name for file.
3. Right-Click on Files and an extension should be as: " .properties" -> config.properties

((( git ignore ...to exclude a file if  you don't want to push it to git repo.)))

Why do we need ( .properties ) file ?
    We use these file to store information like username, password, URL , database connection, and etc to be accessible
    for a joint group of task working on the same framework. So that this information is secured and is not pushed
    with the code on GitHub.
