While Loop:
    It help us repeat the code. We use it because manually copying and pasting is taking time and is not good.
    While Loop also help us reduce the number of lines of code that we have to type.
    Important:
    While Loop always and just works with boolean datatype true or false.... even if we use it through
    relational operators to compare > < , it returns boolean value true or false.

Syntax:
    while (condition){
        system.out.println();
    }
