Logical Operators: ! , && , ==
    It allows us to combine multiple condition. It works with boolean (true/false) values.
Why we should use logical operators?
    1. greatly simplify our condition codes
    2. helps us reduce the huge lines of code that we used to write

NOT ! operator:
    It reverse the conditions, like: something is true, makes it false. if its false

OR || operator:
    It can combine two or more conditions, return true as long as there is one true condition.
    It shows ONLY false, if all conditions are false.
