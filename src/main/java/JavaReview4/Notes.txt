Nested loops:
    Loop inside another loop, called outer loop and the inside one is inner loop
    The inner loop always depends on outer loop.
   if the outer loop condition is false, execution stops and JVM doesn't care about inner loop
   But if the outer loop condition it true, so the loops will go to inner loop and executes it based on number of condition
   Or we can say that The outer loop controls numbers of completing iteration / executions for inner loop
  Also if outer loop condition is 5 times, we know that the entire condition of inner loop repeats 5 times
