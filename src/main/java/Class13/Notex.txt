When we should use String class ?
    When we want to save as much memory as possible, and we are okay if the program is getting slower.

When should we use StringBuilder Class ?
    Whe we want maximum speed, and we don't care how much memory out program is going to occupy.

What does it mean that String is Immutable ?
    It means Strings are not changeable once created in the memory of the computer and the reason they are
    immutable is because the same memory cell can be shared across many variables.
    If we allow any of the variable to change the value it can break the complete system.
