If we Loop on a code and at the same time we want to remove them, we get error on Console
"ConcurrentModificationException" that says, both action are not possible, OR when you loop you cannot remove...
It is only possible if you do it through Iterator from Collection Framework.
----------------------------------
Iterator:


--------------------------------
Lambda Expression -> says:
    From numbers Arraylist, remove the elements if they are greater than 15
                numbers.removeIf(num -> num > 15);
    There is No need to express the Data Type, Lambda Expression recognize or figure out the data type
------------------------------------------------------------

Sets:
    Sets are HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet that don't allow duplicate values. There are 4 main classes
1. HashSet
    Upside: Fast
    Downside: Doesn't retain insertion order , doesn't allow duplicate value
2. LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Retains the Insertion Order
    Downside: Doesn't allow duplicate values and its slower than HashSet
3. TreeSet:
    Upside: It keeps the data sorted (Alphabetically or Chronologically smaller to bigger)
    Downside: It is more slower
