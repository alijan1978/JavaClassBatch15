Loops help us repeat the instructions in code. For example, if we have to print the numbers from our 1 to 100 ,
we can do this by copying and pasting the code which is bad and not scalable. Other way of doing this using Loops.
There are four types of Loops:
1. while loop
2. do while loop
3. for loop
4. enhanced for loop

Break Keyword:
    Break is used to stop iteration just like the condition that we use inside a loop. Always works with if condition.

Continue Keyword:
    It is used to skip all the code written inside the body of the loop when it reaches given condition.
    it also works with if condition.
