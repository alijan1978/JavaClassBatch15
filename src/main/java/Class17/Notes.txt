Access Modifiers:
    These modifiers control the accessibility of instance or static methods and classes. There are four access levels
    and there are three access keyword.
    1. private 2. default 3. protected 4. public

Constructors in Java:
    Constructors help us create objects easily or initialize the instance/object fields of a class in a better way.
Rules:
    1. They are similar to methods, but don't have return types
    2. They have the same name as class name
    3. We can use all the Access Modifiers with the constructors
    4. static keyword cannot be used with the constructors
