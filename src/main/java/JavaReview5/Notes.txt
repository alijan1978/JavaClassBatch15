  Downside of Enhanced Loop:
        We cannot reverse through Enhanced For loop... so we should use Regular For Loop
Important: we used variable 'i' many times because they are local variable used within one block of code
            So other block of code doesn't recognize 'i' variable, ONLY within same block of code we should change
