Set:
    Sets (all three types) don't allow duplicate values.
1. HashSet:
   Upside: Speed is fast
   Downside: It does not maintain insertion order
2. LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Maintains insertion order
    Downside: slower speed than HashSet
3. TreeMap:
    Upside: Keeps the data sorted (chronologically / alphabetically)
    Downside: Its speed is slower than all

Maps:
    Maps three main types and all allow us to store data in the form of Key Value pairs.
1. HashMap (mostly used):
    Upside: speed is fast
    Downside: It doesn't maintain insertion order
2. LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: Maintain insertion order
    Downside: Slower speed than HashSet
3. TreeMap:
    Upside: Keeps the data sorted (chronologically / alphabetically)
    Downside: Speed is slower than all


--------------------------------
If we get the Ouput in Console Not readable... something like this: Entry@1239987
type "to" and press arrow down and selection the 3rd option which is toString() method
it will Override and shows the exact desired output what we want on Console ...
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Entry{" +
                "key=" + key +
                ", value='" + value + '\'' +
                '}';

-------------------------
VAR keyword is a substitute for everything, every data type or collection framework lists
Lambda expression '->' is another new thing
