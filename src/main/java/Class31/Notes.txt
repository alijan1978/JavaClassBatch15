FileHandling in Java:
    Reading and writing data to/from files are called FileHandling. To read or write the data, we should:
    1. We need to know the path/location where file is stored, so that we will be able to read/write that file.
    2. We need to Navigate to that location or bring the file into the memory so that Java program
        can process the data from that file.
We use two classes to navigate the file. FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.
    1. FileInputStream: when we have to read the data.
    2. FileOutputStream: when we have to write the data
Then, we need to know about the Class that knows/recognize or deal how to read and write from an specific file.
For example: We use 'Properties' Class when we have to read the data from ( .properties ) file. OR we use
XSSFWorkbook to read and write the data from ( Excel ) files.

Why should we learn FileHandling?
    1. We will be storing data like username / passwords, URL, type of browsers, etc... all in Configuration files.
    2. When we need to perform Data Driven Testing DDT , we will be storing and reading all the data from the files
        like xlsx or csv files.

How to Read/Write data from files?
    -> Get the path
    -> Use FileInputStream/FileOutputStream to Navigate
    -> Use the specialized Class like Properties or XSSFWorkbook

Runtime Error: it's divided into two parts
    - Exception
    - Error
======================================================================

What are Exceptions in Java?
    Exceptions are runtime issues that can stop normal flow of our program and can abruptly terminate the program
    which is very bad and leads to a bad user experience and showing some Red Lines on Console. It can happen for
    many issues, but always shows where exactly which line number the code has a problem to be fixed.
Exception Handling:
    We stop the program from terminating abruptly, and we try to mitigate the issue by providing a backup code,
    and convert the Error message to simple text.
