Interface:
    Interface is very similar to an abstract class. It is a contract between unrelated classes. We can use it to
    achieve abstraction. All methods are public by default and abstract as well.
    All instance variables are by default final, static and public, they are constants (not changeable).
    We cannot create Object of an interface. We can access or print values in main method System.out.println()
     by calling name of "class.method name".
FYI: 99% of time, interface has abstract  method "void trustAble(){ }"..... by default its abstract

----------------- Encapsulation ------------------------------

1. Create classes, but do not write all your code inside your main method
2. Create getter & setter method and make your fields private so that you have more control over your data that is stored
    or the value you stored in your field so that who/how to access it... the class gets more secure this way.
