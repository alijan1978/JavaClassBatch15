Method Overriding:
    When we have 2 or more methods with the same name on a different class through Parent - Child Inheritance concept
    In overriding, method signature or parameters should be same.
    Another definition: Overriding is a process when the same method exist in Super and Subclass.
Why we use it?
    To provide flexibility and for re-usibility
How to implement?
    1. Through Inheritance
    2. Should be same signature (name+parameters)
    3. same return type
    4. Access Modifiers -> Method must have the same level of visibility or higher access
 ----------------------------------------------------------
Important:
    We can have the same method's name, same access modifier even static in a child class same copy of Parent class,
    we can do it..... just the method's signature or implementation can be different.
    We cannot override static method and private method.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Final Keyword:
      Identifies something is completed and No modification can be done. it can be used with :
    - Variables -> makes variable constant (Not changeable)
    - Methods -> Cannot override it
    - Class -> cannot be inherited
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

 Abstraction:
    It is process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality.
    We use it to reduce complexity, and to improve maintainability and security.
 How to implement Abstraction?
    By using abstract classes, we can achieve 0 - 100 % abstraction
    By using interfaces, we can achieve 0 - 100 % percent abstraction (before Java 8 it was only 100%)

 Abstract class or abstract keyword:
    abstract keyword identifies something is ّّّIncomplete.
