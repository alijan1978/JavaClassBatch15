Method is a block of code that executes/perform that particular action. We use it for re-usability to avoid rewrite
the same method() again and again.

Why we write parameter for method?
    Because to reuse the same method, No need to hard code the same logic again and again

Method Overloading:
      Same class can have 2 or more methods with the same name in the same class, called Method Overloading
    by using different number of parameters / or method signature is different ... drive( )
        by using different type of parameters
        by Sequence
        In overloading we don't care about return type (can be changed) or access modifiers ( can be different)

Method Overriding:
    When we 2 or more methods with the same name on a different class
    When we say two different class, just possible through Parent - Child Inheritance concept
    In overriding, method signature or parameters should be same.
