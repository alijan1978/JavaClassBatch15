Type Casting in Java:
    Its conversion of one data type into another data type. There are two types of Type Casting:
1. UpCasting / Widening Or Implicit Casting or automatic
2. DownCasting / Narrowing or Explicit Casting or Manual

Upcasting: We go from small data type to bigger type: byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double
DownCasting: We go opposite, double -> float -> long -> int -> short -> byte
