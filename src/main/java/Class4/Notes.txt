What are Operators ?
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtractions,
    we can compare things if two entities are the same or not, if a number is greater than the other or not.
    There are three (3) main types of operators.
    1. Arithmetic Operators
    2. Relational Operators
    3. Logical Operators

Arithmetic Operators:
    We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
    +  addition
    - subtraction
    / division
    * multiplication
    % modulus ... Remainder of division quotient

Relational Operators:
    Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. For example, if something is bigger than
    other thing, or if two numbers are the same or not, if two boolean variables contain the same values or not.
    == Equal to
        Used to check if two variables contains the same value or not, if they are the same we get true, otherwise false.
    != Not equal to
        used to check if to variables don't contain the same value. We get a true if they are not the same
    > Greater than
        used to check if one value is greater than other value or not. If greater we get true
    < Less than
        used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on the right side. If smaller, we get true
    >= Greater or Equal to
        If the values on the left is greater than the value on the right side, OR if they are the same, then we get true.
    <= Less than or Equal to
        It's opposite of >= which is used to check if something is less than or equal to other thing or they are the same.

Conditional constructs:
    Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition and if the condition true,
    the Java execute the code otherwise it skips that code.
How to write IfElse Conditions:

    if(condition){
    Any line of code can be written here

    Even we can NestedIf, even another if condition Example:
        if(){

         }
    }

Important Notes:
    1. For String, we use equal method ( name.equals(name) ) ... instead of == sign, because its non-primitive datatype
    2. WE can use cmd+opt+l (Mac) OR Ctrl+alt+l (Windows) to format out code
    3. If we are confused about the brackets { } , click on the opening or closing part of brackets to check the other part

If else condition:
    When I have to test the same variable for multiple conditions, I should use (IfElseIf )
    when I have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other NestedIf conditions
