Right click on your project
- Create New Directory and name it Files (whatever), if you cannot create directory you can create package too
- Then create File and name it, inside your directory
For example: config.properties and type your user/password information with the URL you want to work on it.

To read the content of the config.properties file, we should right-click on it and choose copy path/reference
(choose content root ) it's better if it didn't work, choose the absolute root and then paste it in a class to be assigned in a variable, like this.

String path = "Files/config.properties";


try & Catch block acts as a backup block of code to perform plan A if not plan B
But if we use Excel file, we should have the jar files downloaded from Apache Poi ...then we should import this jar in our class
click on Project Structure, be on Modules and then on Dependencies and then click on + sign and find your poi.bin jar files and add it.

Important:
    To have automatic import works , go to Intellij Setting -> Auto Import
    Then check mark the -> add ambigious import on fly ... so that you don't worry to manually import a new java class

Java Bytecode and JVM working:

   When we type Java code, its called ( Source Code ) then Java has a compiler that converts the source code
   to Bytecode program where the JVM (Java virtual machine) can understand or has capabilities that knows for this specific bytecode
   what method or implementation I should be calling. like for every package or class that we create there is
   an OUT package which is the production files are get created to change the source code to bytecode.

   Then with the help of ( Fern flower ) decompiler tool, the bytecode is converted back to source code.
